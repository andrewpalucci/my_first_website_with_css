# my_first_website_with_css

In my first repository, "my_first_website", I gained some experience making a website with strictly HTML. 

Following the Odin project, I have now gained some experience in using CSS - specifically the basics such as text formatting, padding margins and borders, and the basic uses of flexbox. 

Using this, I am going to work on the project at the end of The Odin Project Foundation Course's CSS section, "Project: Landing Page". 

Check out my work!
